## Problems we’re solving

Cryptocurrency payments have multiple upsides over traditional rails including no fees, no charge-backs, and instant settlements, globally connected and accessible from day one, but currently accepting cryptocurrency, let alone Solana payments is hard!. The three major friction for businesses to accept Solana Payments are:

### 1. Too technical

The roadblock to accepting Solana and overall cryptocurrency payments is the availability of no great infrastructure providers and everything being too technical for merchants, whose focus is on growing their products and businesses over building a payment layer right from scratch!

### 2. Hard integration and unbearable UX

Available crypto payment infrastructure providers like Coinbase Commerce and BitPay

- Does not support Solana and SPL Tokens
- Are hard to integrate, and manage and cause issues to scale
- The UX to Pay is crappy, and unreliable from a customer perspective

### 3. No mobile support

A major fraction of Solana users are mobile-native and the upcoming wave of new users will be mobile-heavy too. Still, almost all payment providers don't work well on mobile devices, and the UX is unbearable for users

## Introducing: Checkout

To solve these problems, we created "Checkout", in the first release we'll power these main features at the core,

### 1. Pre-built Checkout solution

Checkout is a low-code solution for businesses to accept Solana Payments with ease. It powers a pre-built checkout page with all the necessary components it takes for businesses to accept and users to pay in Solana and SPL tokens. No tech jargon, no need to handle wallets, QR codes, or building everything from scratch, we do that for you! Meanwhile, the end-user experience is Top-Notch and built to convert them into paid users, by offering multiple payment streams (Connect wallet for desktop, Tap to Pay for mobile, and QR Code payment for IRL payments) and major Solana tokens (USDC, SOL, DUST, etc.)

### 2. Powering ‘one-click’ Tap to Pay UX for mobile

We are proud to be the first-ever fully mobile native payments solution offering ‘one-click’ Tap to Pay UX for mobile users, which is on par with that of Apple Pay and Google Pay and is built on the ‘[Solana Pay](https://solanapay.com/) protocol’!

## Features

### Non-Custodial, forever

Our Checkout solution is non-custodial forever, i.e **we don’t hold your funds at any point**, and payments get transferred to your Solana wallet with an **instant settlement** as soon as someone made a payment on your website or app!

- **Powerful Dashboard to manage everything**

  We power merchant onboarding through a powerful dashboard where teams can manage all their payments, API Keys, business name + assets, and everything included in order to keep your payments going breeze! Further versions will also support analytics to analyze your business performance and serve users better

- **Support for swap transactions**

  Cryptocurrencies are volatile in nature and businesses need to secure their earnings from price fluctuations! To ensure this, we support "Swap Transactions", where end users can choose to pay from multiple supported SPL tokens (SAMO, DUST, GARI) and SOL itself, but merchants will only receive USDC (fully backed stablecoin) and can remain stress free from price fluctuations!

- **Mobile Native, Multi Pay methods with the best UX**

  Our checkout solution is **mobile native from day one**, powering best-in-class UX.
  Currently, we currently support three payment methods based on user devices so they can choose according to their convenience,

  - Connect wallet, and extension wallet payments for desktop
  - One-click tap to pay for mobile
  - QR Code scan to pay for desktop and mobile both

- **Multiple SPL tokens support**

  Merchants can choose and configure multiple SPL tokens (like DUST, GARI, SAMO, etc) they would like to offer to their users! We only support a pool of whitelisted tokens based on certain parameters, but launch partners can contact us to add tokens of their choice!

- **Easy-to-use SDKs supporting multi-stack integration**

  Our SDK allows teams or businesses to start accepting Solana payments in just a few lines of code, without any hassle on web3 jargon. We cover them all for you with a pre-built hosted checkout solution. Our SDK is built to primarily power Node and React/Next TS framework, but we are open to power Native, Flutter and other web or mobile frameworks as the need arises!

## Platform fees

Our final platform fee is still under active discussion!
For the Launch Partners, we are only charging a small 1% fee on each payment, for the first 4 months till we conclude a final pricing model! 

NO set-up, hidden, or one-time fees, we only charge whenever you earn something while powering the most seamless UX which works best for both you as a merchant and your users!
