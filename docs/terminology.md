# Terminology

## Metaplex

Metaplex enables artists and creators to launch self-hosted NFT storefronts as easily as building a website. Ultra-fast NFTs with insanely low minting fees.

Metaplex is a Solana-powered protocol that allows for the creation and minting of non-fungible tokens, auctions, and visualizing NFTs in a standard way across wallets and applications, comprised of two core components: an on-chain program, and a self-hosted front-end web2 application.

## Candy Machine

Candy Machine is a tool that utilizes the Metaplex CLI to generate an NFT, link a picture and relevant metadata to the NFT token, and setup a fair auction.

## Solana Pay

Solana Pay is a new, open, and free-to-use payments framework built on Solana — the world’s most performant web3 ecosystem. Solana Pay is built for immediate transactions, fees that are fractions of a penny, and a net-zero environmental impact.

## Transaction Request URL

Transaction Request URLs are data strings used to request, query, and build specific Solana transactions.
